FROM python:3.11-slim

# Create a working directory

# Copy only the requirements file first (for efficient caching)
COPY requirements.txt ./

# Install your Python dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy only what's needed:
    COPY app.py ./
    COPY templates/ templates/
    COPY static/ static/

# Make sure the templates and static files are in the right place
# If they are in subfolders like 'templates/' or 'static/', they
# should be copied into the container accordingly. For example:
# COPY templates/ /app/templates/
# COPY static/ /app/static/

# Expose the port (optional; helps documentation)
EXPOSE 5000

# Use Gunicorn to run Flask in production
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:5000", "app:app"]
